 Please use  the credentials for login : 

User : 123456789

Please use below URL to test the application :
 
To Check the balance : 
http://localhost:8102/api/showBalance

To withdraw the balance : 
http://localhost:8102/api/withdraw/200

Here 200 is the amount to be withdrawn. 

Here as I have not used the DB due to time constraint and hence the data is available only for one session.

Further Enhancements : 
Create the DB and access via DB.
Provide an user interface. 
Also can be made more secure using the token like JWT .
